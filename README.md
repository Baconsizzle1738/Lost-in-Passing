# Desription
A little pawn has decided to be special and took en-passant on its own. Little did it know, the consequences of its actions would be...  interesting.

Lost in the void, the little pawn still seeks the desired promotion, but the new environment it finds itself in would make that dream a bit challenging. The enemy pieces all seem to be there and yet they aren't... and attempting to capture one may lead to an unsavory end.

# Controls
The controls are simple. When it is the player's turn to move, there will be purple hitboxes that appear on the squares that the player can move to. Click on the hitboxes to move to that square.

When the player moves to a square occupied by a void piece or if a void piece move to the player's position, the player falls into the void (basically death).
